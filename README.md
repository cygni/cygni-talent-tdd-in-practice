# Welcome!

Your assignment is to implement a calculator-function using TDD.

## Requirements

- Node.js (>= 12)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm test` - run the tests in watch mode.

## Getting started

1. Run npm install
2. Run npm run test
3. Start writing tests

## The assignment

A calculator function, that takes an expression as a string, and returns a string value.

You need to support addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

Examples:

- "4+4" returns "8"
- "5\*5" returns "25"
- "8/2+2" returns "6"
- "16*7/-14+15/10*-2" returns "-11"

Write test cases to fulfill the requirements. Then make the tests green!

Follow the TDD rules:

1.  Write new code only if you first have a failing automated test.
2.  Eliminate duplication.
